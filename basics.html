                <h3>White T-Shirt</h3>
                <p>A fitted white t-shirt that is full length is more versatile since it can be worn in more professional settings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column" >
                <h3>Blue Jeans</h3>
                <p>Denim is absolutely necessary in any wardrobe. Regardless of your body type, finding a pair that is flattering is
                    possible! When choosing a color, a darker wash is more versatile and a pair with no holes looks fancier as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Black Dress</h3>
                <p>A little black dress has been one of the most popular item of clothing for nearly a century. Many clothing companies
                    offer at least one variation of this dress at a variety of price points. Can be paired with various kinds of shoes
                    and accessories depending on if you want to dress it up or dress it down.</p>

                <h3>Black Blazer</h3>
                <p>A blazer can act as an extremely versatile layering piece. It can make any outfit look more polished and make you look
                    more put together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>White or Colorful Button Up</h3>
                <p>A white button up can be worn for both informal and formal occasions. Buttoning up the shirt and tucking it into your
                    pants looks clean and professional while using it as an outer layer over tanks and t-shirts can give you a more relaxed look.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Neutral-Colored Sneaker</h3>
                <p>Sneakers that are grey, tan, white, and other earth-tone colors can be worn during any season of the year. They can be paired
                    with jeans and a white t-shirt, or with dresses for a more casual look.</p>

    <h2>Quick Tips on How to Shop:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When going to the dressing room, bring multiple sizes so that you do not have to move back and forth.</li><br>
        <li>Try to see the clothing on in front of multiple mirrors in different lighting.
            Some stores have mirrors that are slightly warped in dressing rooms.</li><br>
        <li>Shopping together with someone may prevent you from purchasing quality pieces that you will truly treasure.
            Their own personal style should not influence yours.</li><br>
        <li>Avoid purchasing a clothing piece just because the price is right(example: a shirt is on sale for
            half of the original price, but the color is not your favorite).</li><br>
        <li> If there is an expensive style of clothing you want to buy, test-drive it with a budget friendly
            option first.</li> <br>
        <li> Make sure to check the return policy, especially with big purchases at department stores. </li><br>
        <li>Online retailers may offer a larger selection of styles and color. However, it is recommended to only
            purchase items that you are confident about, such as loose t-shirts. Jeans or tight-fitting tops should
            be tried on in-person since they are riskier.</li> <br>
        <li>Before going online or in-person shopping, look up coupon codes and shipping promos on various websites.</li> <br>
