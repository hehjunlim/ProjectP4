        <h2>The Seasons</h2>
        <h3>Summer</h3>
            <p>Summer is the hottest time of the year. Fortunately, layering is not needed. Some of the most popular items of
            clothing worn are made out of light material, such as linen. Shoes that are comfortable yet light such as
            sandals are recommended.</p>

        <h3>Fall</h3>
        <p>Fall is the period of browns, oranges, as well as different mild and
            comfortable colors. Because fall acts as a transitional period between the hottest to coldest time of the year,
            it is important to introduce light jackets such as vests into your daily wardrobe.
            Boots are the chosen variety of footwear to wear especially in the fall season as well.</p>

        <h3>Winter</h3>
        <p>Winter is coldest time of the year. Layering clothing is important to shield against the weather.
            Heavy coats, jackets, and comfortable sweaters are necessary and accessories such as mitts, stockings, caps,
            and earmuffs can add more warmth.</p>

    <h2>Quick Tips on How to Shop:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When going to the dressing room, bring multiple sizes so that you do not have to move back and forth.</li><br>
        <li>Try to see the clothing on in front of multiple mirrors in different lighting.
            Some stores have mirrors that are slightly warped in dressing rooms.</li><br>
        <li>Shopping together with someone may prevent you from purchasing quality pieces that you will truly treasure.
            Their own personal style should not influence yours.</li><br>
        <li>Avoid purchasing a clothing piece just because the price is right(example: a shirt is on sale for
            half of the original price, but the color is not your favorite).</li><br>
        <li> If there is an expensive style of clothing you want to buy, test-drive it with a budget friendly
            option first.</li> <br>
        <li> Make sure to check the return policy, especially with big purchases at department stores. </li><br>
        <li>Online retailers may offer a larger selection of styles and color. However, it is recommended to only
            purchase items that you are confident about, such as loose t-shirts. Jeans or tight-fitting tops should
            be tried on in-person since they are riskier.</li> <br>
        <li>Before going online or in-person shopping, look up coupon codes and shipping promos on various websites.</li> <br>
